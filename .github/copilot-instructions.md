# Introduction

This library `bun-ws-router` is a WebSocket router for Bun implemented in TypeScript. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle WebSocket connections and route messages to different handlers based on the message type. It's intended to be used together with Zod-based validation for message types.

One of the design goals of this library is to complement existing WebSocket functionality already provided by Bun, including PubSub.
